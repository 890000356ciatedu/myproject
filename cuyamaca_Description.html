<h2><center>Description</center></h2>
<br>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;On clear days visibility from the summit of Cuyamaca Peak can range from 60–100 miles (97–161 km) in nearly every direction. 
To the west, the Pacific Ocean, the Coronado Islands of Mexico, the coast line of San Diego County, Viejas Mountain, and El Cajon Mountain can be seen. 
Looking north, one can see 6,140-foot (1,870 m) Palomar Mountain among the ridge of Palomar Mountains. On very clear days 8,716-foot (2,657 m) Toro Peak in the Santa Rosas and the San Jacintos are visible. Closer yet is Volcan Mountain slightly to the northeast, the former gold rush town of Julian lying in front. Directly north are the closest summits, Middle and North Peaks. 
Directly east is the Anza Borrego Desert and the Laguna Mountains, including Whale Peak. Far beyond is the Salton Sea. To the south are Lyons Peak and Lawson Peak; further yet and to the southeast are Mexican border mountains such as Table Top Mountain and the Sierra de Juárez. </p> 
<br>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Cuyamaca Peak is located roughly 40 miles (64 km) from the Pacific Ocean, within Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. It is east of the city of San Diego and southwest of Julian. 
A popular 3.5-mile (5.6 km) year round hike to the summit of Cuyamaca leads from the Paso Picacho Campground, starting at about 5,000 feet (1,500 m). </p>
<br>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; Snows in winter are common above 5,000 feet (1,500 m) and surrounding regions in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. During summer, Bracken Ferns, a variety of wildflowers and native bunchgrasses dominate mountain meadows and the forest floor. Prior to the Cedar Fire, Black oaks once lit up the mountain. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Cuyamaca Peak, the second highest point in San Diego County, looms tall on the western edge of Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. There are many trails and fire roads that can be used to craft different routes up the summit, but the most direct and popular course is to climb the Lookout Fire Road, starting at Paso Picacho Campground. This road, being entirely paved asphalt, is also the only hike in the park that dogs are allowed on.
