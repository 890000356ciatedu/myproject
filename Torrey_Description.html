<h2><center>Description</center></h2>
<br>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve, located on the cliffs above Torrey Pines State Beach, is a 1,750 acre 
reserve dedicated to preserving its namesake, the Torrey Pine tree and other indigenous wildlife in its native environment.
A coastal wilderness of pine forests and sandstone canyons, the park has a series of well-kept trails that wind along the 
cliffs offering breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean. With both easy, family-friendly paths and more advanced trails, 
the park provides a great hiking experience for all levels.
<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Virtually everything in Torrey Pines is protected, from the Peñasquitos River Valley on the east side of the highway, to the Natural Reserve lands on the west, to the Underwater Ecological Reserve offshore. The world-famous Torrey Pines Golf Course helps to safeguard the southern end of the bluffs from development while the rugged cliffs do their part to discourage access and crowds.
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve is home to approximately 3,000 of our nation's rarest pine tree—Pinus torreyana, which only grows here and on Santa Rosa Island off the coast near Santa Barbara. The park preserves not only the trees, but also one of the last great salt marshes and waterfowl refuges in Southern California.  
<br>
<br>
Eight miles of trails offer a variety of distances and different experiences. Here are a few popular trails:
<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;• Guy Fleming Trail: This 0.7 mile loop is the easiest trail in the park and affords stunning ocean views. Two overlooks offer differing experiences: On the North Overlook you can inspect the Torrey pines up close and view the Peñasquitos Marsh, while the South Overlook features views of La Jolla to the south, San Clemente to the north and perhaps as far out to sea as the Santa Catalina Islands. Spring rains bring abundant wildflowers, and in winter, views of gray whales migrating up and down the coastline. 
<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;• Razor Point Trail: Although there are fewer Torrey pines along this 1.4 mile round-trip trail, you’ll see dramatic views of ravines and badlands and the path ends at a spectacular ocean lookout. The trail meets up with other trails along the way so an alternate path back is possible.
<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;• Beach Trail:  As the name implies, this 3/4 mile trail takes you down to Torrey Pines State Beach. While steep and less scenic than the others, it can be a great workout or adventure as you can hike and then picnic and sunbathe on a wide, flat beach.
