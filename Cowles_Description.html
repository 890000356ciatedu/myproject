<h2><center>Description</center></h2>
<br>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;“Cowles Mountain is a prominent mountain within the city limits of San Diego, California and also within Mission Trails Regional Park. The mountain is named after George A. Cowles, an early ranching pioneer in San Diego County. Its 1,593-foot summit is the highest point in the city of San Diego. The main trail to the summit is a popular hiking destination taking hundreds of people per day to a breathtaking 360-degree panorama of San Diego County. The round trip hike is around 3 miles long and an elevation change of about 950 feet.”</p> 
<br>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Cowles Mountain is probably the most popular hiking destination in San Diego, and of the several possible routes to the peak, the trail starting at Golfcrest and Navajo is by far the most heavily used (check out our write-ups of alternate starting points Big Rock Park and Barker Way). This is not the hike to do if you are looking for some quiet solitude to commune with nature, as you will be sharing the trail with dozens of other hikers and runners (many of whom choose to disregard the “no amplified music” rule and broadcast their tunes for everyone to hear). Parking here can also be a significant challenge – at peak times its so busy that cars line the street as far as the eye can see. In fact, this trail is so popular that Mission Trails Regional Park has created the 5-Peak Challenge to encourage hikers to explore other areas of the park in the hopes of alleviating some of the parking issues. But despite the crowds, this is still a really beautiful hike with some of the best views within the city limits. It provides a great workout and is a choice spot for watching sunrise, sunset, or enjoying a full moon..</p>
<br>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; Being the most popular trail in the county means that the it suffers a significant amount of wear and tear. The City of San Diego, along with Mission Trails staff and volunteers, do a tremendous job of maintaining the trail. In fact, the trail was actually closed for a full two months in 2013 for restoration work. Today, we saw evidence of the never ending work of keeping the trail maintained in the form of caution tape marking the side of the trail.
